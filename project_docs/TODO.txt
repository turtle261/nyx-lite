PRE RELEASE:
* documentation
  * a minimal fuzzing example
  * cleaning up lint errors
  * comments on the actual api

* proper memory api (p1)
  * Process Memory Abstraction
  * Api that returns shared pages to process memory
  * Allow to not reset shared pages
  * Add testing
  * make a generic Reader/Writer implementation for virtual memory
Debug APIs:
  * Inject Mapping / Inject Code
  * Explore DS /BTS Branch Trace Storage via MSR_IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR
Better Memory management
  * Use userfault_fd / signals to allow to have both EPT based breakpoints & shared root snapshots
  * Reduce unnecessary memory by making root snapshot shared between VMs 
Loading VMs
  * fix add api to load dockerfiles directly
  * investigate mke2fs to turn docker image into fs image
  * fix api to load a rootdir based fs directly, rather than going through
    docker first

bugfixes:
* DONE: test and ensure SIMD instructions calculate correct memory accesses for ExitReason::BadMemoryAccess
* DONE: fix BTF Branch Based single step via MSR_IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR
* fix kvm dirty ring api to speed up snapshots
* fix host atomic bitmap to speed up snapshots
* fix nested virtualization
* DONE: fix console output by redirect serial into a ptty (serial_out_path now defaults to a PTY when unset)
* DONE: ensure snapshot reset fixes VM shutdown
* DONE: changing IP resets vm.continuation state as appropriate (set_regs now resets continuation)
* DONE: regs() and sregs() are cached during run loop
* DONE: speed up breakpoints by not enabling/disabling them ALL the time.
